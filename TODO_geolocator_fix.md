# Fix geolocator_apple module not found issue

## Problem
Module 'geolocator_apple' not found in Xcode build

## Root Cause
- Missing ephemeral configuration files in ios/Flutter/ephemeral/
- iOS platform version may be too low (geolocator requires iOS 13.0+)
- CocoaPods dependencies not properly installed

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Clean Flutter project
- [x] Remove build artifacts: `flutter clean`
- [x] Remove iOS Pods and Podfile.lock: `rm -rf ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock`
- [x] Clear Xcode derived data: `rm -rf ios/DerivedData`

### Step 2: Update iOS platform version
- [x] Uncomment and set `platform :ios, '13.0'` in ios/Podfile

### Step 3: Regenerate Flutter iOS configuration
- [x] Run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies
- [x] Run `flutter create . --platforms ios` to regenerate Xcode configuration
- [x] Verify ephemeral files are created in ios/Flutter/ephemeral/

### Step 4: Install CocoaPods dependencies
- [x] Navigate to ios directory: `cd ios`
- [x] Run `pod repo update` to ensure latest pod specs
- [x] Run `pod install` to install dependencies
- [x] Navigate back to root: `cd ..`

### Step 5: Verify and test build
- [x] Run `flutter build ios --debug` to verify the build
- [ ] If successful, run `flutter run` to test on simulator

## Expected Outcome
After completing these steps, the `geolocator_apple` module should be properly integrated and the iOS build should succeed without the "Module 'geolocator_apple' not found" error.

## Notes
- The geolocator plugin v11.0.0 requires iOS 13.0+ minimum
- Using `use_frameworks!` in Podfile is required for Swift-based plugins
- The ephemeral configuration files are generated by `flutter create` and contain necessary build settings
